**GAML** is a tool for modding games made in the Godot Engine.
<hr/>

## Why GAML?

**GAML** has more advanced functionality that other Godot modding tools (such as [GUMM](https://github.com/KoBeWi/Godot-Universal-Mod-Manager/)) lack.

This includes but is not limited to:
- **Script hooking** (via [hehlib](https://github.com/kermeow/gaml/tree/master/mod-loader/hehlib))
- **Runs first** (GAML and mods are loaded before the game)
- **Mod dependencies**
- **Attaches to any game**
